## Baby-steps Towards the Construction of a Mail Server â€” Parsing in Python
The goal for the first half of the course is to build a simple mail server and mail reader that will work with standard Internet mail servers using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and POP (Post Office Protocol), and mail readers such as Gmail, Apple Mail, and certain versions of Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook. This assignment is the first (very!) small piece of the mail server: a simple string parser that we will build upon in later assignments. 
**For a detailed description of the assignment, please see the assignment documentation.**
